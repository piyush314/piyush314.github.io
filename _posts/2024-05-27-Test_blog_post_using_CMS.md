I've created a content management system for this website using Flask and Python. I'm currently working on updating a blog post using this system. Hopefully, I'll be able to share this content management system on GitHub soon so that everyone can see and use it. However, at the moment, it's still in a somewhat basic form. I plan to wait for a couple of days before sharing it.
